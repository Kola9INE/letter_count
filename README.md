# letter_count
# A simple algorithm that counts the distribution of the English letters in a document.
* Two different documents were used for this study, though the algorithm was written to process only one document. You can modify it to process more than one documents.
* The document was parsed into python using the pyPDF library.
* A script was extract the frequency per english letters in the document.
* Another script was written to visualize the result as a bar plot.

# DID YOU KNOW THE LETTER 'e' HAPPENS TO BE THE MOST FREQUENT (IRRESPECTIVE OF THE DOCUMENT), FOLLOWED BY 'a' and 't' ('a' might come second or third, same with 't').
*For maximum result, use a text of at least 10,000 characters or 50 pages.
